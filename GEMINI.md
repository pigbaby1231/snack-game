# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This directory appears to be a new project for a web-based game. Based on the directory name "game" and its location within an "html" folder, this project is likely intended to be a game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## File Structure

A typical file structure for a simple web game would be:

```
/
|-- index.html
|-- style.css
|-- script.js
|-- GEMINI.md
```

*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the game, containing the HTML structure.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the game, containing all the visual styles.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
*   `GEMINI.md`: This file, providing context and instructions for the project.

## Building and Running

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

*   **HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 tags where appropriate.
*   **CSS:** Keep the CSS organized and readable. Consider using a methodology like BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) if the project grows in complexity.
*   **JavaScript:** Write clean, modular, and well-commented JavaScript code.
